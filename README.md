# Message Bombing Tool

This is a message bombing tool made on top of python. It is a very very small application but it might help you out. Got a few minutes, thought of making this app and practise a bit. Thanks!

  - Type anything on anywhere
  - Type as much as you want
  - And Magic!!!!!

I used only one third party package called `pyautogui` which will help you to write. In order to install it, you have to type this command,
```python
    pip install pyautogui
```

After installing, run the run_me.py file and in the meantime, go to the app from where you want to send the message and click on the message box, after **5** seconds, it will start sending. You can change the time of wait and sending. Modify the file as you like!
